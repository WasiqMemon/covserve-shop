## Background

Since the outset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, students from different fields have put forward unique solutions to various problems created by the pandemic. One of the major problems was access to necessary precautionary and self-care items. Amid the lockdown, when shops and markets were closed or visiting them in-person was not safe, people needed a safe place to get their masks, sanitizers, gloves, and other necessary precaution gear. The need of the time was an online system with access to all precautionary items in one place. Covserve is our answer to this problem. Covserve is a Database System where suppliers can add all their products to the database while customers can search their favorite items in the inventory and purchase them.
